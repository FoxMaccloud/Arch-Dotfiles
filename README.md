### Arch Linux configuration made and used by [FoxMaccloud](https://foxmaccloud.com/).
</div>

I'm posting my dotfiles because some people wanted me to share.
I like a minimalistic enviorment. I made a website which would be cool if you checked out.
Check it out at https://foxmaccloud.com/

The content I post on my website will go in the infosec direction, but I might post other content aswell.
I mainly post research, blogposts and ctf writeups.
  
| Distribution   | Arch Linux | Contrary to popular belief Arch is the best distribution.                                       |
|----------------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Window Manager | i3-gaps    | I like i3-gaps since it's fast and works great on my laptop. Makes me unreliant on a mouse.     |
| Shell          | Zsh        | Zsh is an amazing replacement to bash. It also helps me with spelling correction xD.            |
| Terminal       | Kitty      | I used to use URXVT, but I now use Kitty because of it's GPU acceleration.                      |
| Bar            | Polybar    | Polybar is a great bar. I swapped to this after using the standard i3bar for a while.           |
| Browser        | FireFox    | Firefox, guuuuud...                                                                             |
| Editor         | Vim        | I use vim for everything. My goto editor. I also use full IDEs when the situation calls for it. |
| Video Player   | VLC        | Just my goto video player...                                                                    |
| Music Player   | Spotify    | My family pays for my spotify... I also use Cmus.                                               |
| Image viewer   | feh        | Just a minimalisitc image viewer.                                                               |
| Font           | Nerd Fonts | I use fonts from the Nerd Fonts package.                                                        |
| Compositor     | Picom      | Currently using picom which is a fork of compton.                                               |
| Menu           | Dmenu      | I just use Dmenu. I also have used Rofi which is nice.                                          |

## Installation

I have tried making an installation script for my configs. It's a work in progress atm, so please report any bugs, features you want added or enhancements.

To install, simply clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/FoxMaccloud/Arch-Dotfiles
```
and run the installationscript

Note that the script will need root privileges as it will try to fetch the programs it's missing.
```
chmod +x install.sh
sudo bash install.sh
```
You can also install it manually without the script.
